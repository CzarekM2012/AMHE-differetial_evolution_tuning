# AMHE-differential_evoltion_tunig

This project examines methods of mutation range tuning in basic differential evolution algorithm (rand/1/bin).

### Tuning methods
 - Median Success Rule (MSR)
 - Population Success Rule (PSR)

### Effectiveness examination
Implemented methods are tested on problems with search spaces with 10 and 30 dimensions. CEC 2017 benchmark is used.
